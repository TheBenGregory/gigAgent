# gigAgent

This project is my capstone project for the client-side portion of Nashville Software School Cohort #50

## About 

gigAgent creates a gig-economy within an existing industry by creating work opportunities for less busy agents and services for busy agents. . The app connects agents with other agents who are able and willing to show a house on their behalf in exchange for payment. The app will allow agents to register as available in an area as well as register as a user needing assistance. 

Once an agent registers as available, another agent can request they do a showing on their behalf. That agent can in turn accept or deny the request. The showing agent can mark complete once a showing has happened and get paid for their time. 

## Stack 

gigAgent is built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React

## Future Plans

I intend to keep developing this project on the side. There are still a handful of bugs present and a list of items I will add as I go including:
* Image upload (code is written but not working at present)
* Complete functionality of the "mark complete" option to switch the isComplete boolean
* Complete gigAgents cards to display with user photo and bio
* Overhaul of color scheme

These are a few of the immediate tickets I will tackle on this project.
