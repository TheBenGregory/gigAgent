This project is my capstone project for the client-side portion of Nashville Software School Cohort #50

## About 

gigAgent creates a gig-economy within an existing industry by creating work opportunities for less busy agents and services for busy agents. . The app connects agents with other agents who are able and willing to show a house on their behalf in exchange for payment. The app will allow agents to register as available in an area as well as register as a user needing assistance. 

Once an agent registers as available, another agent can request they do a showing on their behalf. That agent can in turn accept or deny the request. The showing agent can mark complete once a showing has happened and get paid for their time.
